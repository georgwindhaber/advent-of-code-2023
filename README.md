# Georg's Advent Of Code 2023

Heyo! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ„

These are my advent of code challenges.

They are done in `TypeScript` and to bring a little spice in, run in `Bun` instead of the commonly used `Node.js`

Every day is a new Bun project, with the first task being `index.ts` and the second being `advancement.ts`

With Bun install you can run them with `bun run index.ts` and `bun run advancement.ts` in the corresponding folder.
